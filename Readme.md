# MSFS Variable Watcher

## Monitor LVARs
This tool helps you to find LVARs for MSFS quick and easy. <br/>
Simply run the `MSFSVariableWatcher.exe` and visit `http://localhost:7672/` in a web browser of your choise. <br/>
Make sure to have MSFS running _before_ launching MSFSVariableWatcher.

You will find a simple UI where you can search for LVARs and much more.  <br/>
By default, it will only show LVARs that have recently changed.

To monitor SimVars, I recommend the SimvarWatcher included in the MSFS SDK.
